# Packet sniffing with Wireshark

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that's open source and used for monitoring and analyzing Network traffic. It's a packet sniffing tool that captures and dissects data packets traveling across a network and it will provide you a detailed and real-time view of communication patterns and in Cybersecurity it's used to detect potential security threats, detect malicious activities, Network vulnerabilities. By looking into the packet's contents you can examine communication protocols and apply filters and uncover anomalies, you can see unauthorized access attempts and signs of malicious software that can be invaluable in things like instant response forensics, vulnerability assessments and enabling cybersecurity practitioners to gain insights into Network behavior and strenghten their defenses.

# The Project: Analyzing HTTP Traffic and Identifying Security Issues

We will capture and analyze HTTP traffic to identify potential security issues such as unencrypted credentials, suspicious URLs or unauthorized access attempts.

We will divide the project into 3 sections:

- Capture: web browsing, logging into websites, access different HTTP based services

- Analyze: understanding the information exchanged between the client and the server

- Report: document your findings and observations (how to potentially fix the vulnerabilities)
